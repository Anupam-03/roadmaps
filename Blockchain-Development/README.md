# Blockchain Development 
There are two major roles in Blockchain development
1. Blockchain Core developer (10% jobs)
2. Blockchain Software developer (90% jobs)

> Now let's first discuss the role of Blockchain Core Developer and ideal roadmap to follow
### Blockchain Core Developer responsibilities

-  Blockchain consensus

### Things to learn
- Programing Language like. C++, Rust, Go (bcz they are good in Blockchain implementation)
- Some core computer science subjects ðŸ‘‡
  - Computer Architecture
  - cryptography
  - Data structures and Algorithm
  - Computer Networks

> Now let's move ahead and discuss most demanding job role- Blockchain Software developer
> NOTE: Here we are going to to discuss the roadmap in the context of ethereum blockchain because of the following reason
>  - Most popular
>  - Most demanding
>  - Developer friendly
>  - Resource and community support
>  - After learning this you can also switch to BlockChains like solana, polygon etc. because fundamentals are going to remain the same
